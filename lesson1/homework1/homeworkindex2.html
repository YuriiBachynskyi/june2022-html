    <p>Сімейство Сімпсонів складається з вигаданих персонажів мультсеріалу Сімпсони. Сімпсони - це нуклеарна сім'я, що
        складається з подружжя Гомера і Мардж і їх трьох дітей Барта, Лізи і Меггі. Вони живуть на 742 Evergreen Terrace у
        вигаданому містечку Спрінгфілд, Сполучені Штати, і їх створив карикатурист Метт Гронінг, який задумав персонажів на
        честь членів своєї родини, замінивши своє ім’я на «Барт». Сім'я дебютувала на телеканалі Fox 19 квітня 1987 року в
        короткометражному фільмі "На добраніч" у Шоу Трейсі Уллман, а пізніше вони були виділені у власний серіал, який
        дебютував на Fox у США 17 грудня 1989 року.

        Окрім п’яти головних членів родини, у їхній сім’ї є ряд інших головних і другорядних персонажів. Найбільш часто
        повторювані персонажі: батько Гомера Авраам «Дідусь» Сімпсон; сестри Мардж Петті і Сельма Був'є; і двоє домашніх
        улюбленців родини, Маленький помічник Діда Мороза та Сніжок II. Серед інших членів родини – мати Гомера Мона
        Сімпсон, зведений брат Гомера Герберт Пауелл, мати Мардж Жаклін Був’є та інші неповнолітні родичі.</p>
    <h1><a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Homer_Simpson">Homer</a></h1>
    <img src="img2/Homer.png" alt="Homer">
    <p>Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956)[36] is the main protagonist of The Simpsons series (or show). He is the spouse
        of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be ~240 pounds), lazy,
        and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love,
        and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. He also serves as the main
        protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie.

        His favorite color is blue and he enjoys dancing, eating donuts, drinking, hugging, driving a sit-down arcade racer,
        playing the piano and horse riding. His favorite kiddie rides are "Stuart Little", "Barney Train" and "Ride the
        Champion Mechanical Horse".

        Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he is
        often incompetent and negligent towards his duties. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern with his
        friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard, and Moe Szyslak. At home, he can often be found sitting on the
        couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and drinking Duff. Homer is also the only son of Abraham Simpson
        II and Mona Simpson. When provoked, he often strangles Bart for pressuring him. Even though he mutually hates his
        wife's sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier, he played Selma's husband for her to adopt Ling and agreed to be the
        minister for Patty's intended homosexual marriage. As a result of this, Homer is his legal adoptive father.[37]

        Homer may just be a normal man, but he has had many great achievements and experiences in his life. He has won a
        Grammy, an Academy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, been to space and saved Springfield many times.

        Homer is named after Matt Groening's late father Homer Groening. In a series of interviews in 1990, Groening
        reportedly stated that he named the character after the Homer Simpson in The Day Of the Locust, a 1939 novel by
        Nathanael West according to Planet Simpson, but neither explanation is considered definitive.</p>

    <img src="img2/Bart.png" alt="Bart">
    <p>Bartholomew "Bart" Jojo Simpson (born April 1[7] or February 23[8]) is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood,
        disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is the only son of
        Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after
        discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit",
        "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson
        Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.

        Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web series[9], he has
        discovered a new comet which was named after him[10], and he also has performed in a successful band with Milhouse
        Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum.[11]</p>

    <h1><a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Simpson">Lisa</a></h1>
    <img src="img2/Lisa.png" alt="Lisa">
    <p>Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9)[9] is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the two
        tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.

        In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called Lil'
        Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement of
        the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family.
        In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing
        saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity
        is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. She focuses on
        her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already a member of Mensa with an IQ
        of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out to those who she deems lower than her or even
        above her. She has extreme jealously from time to time and will do whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the
        smartest; but only if she deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the intelligent one who usually thinks things
        through.</p>
